## Usage

- **Preprocessing**: Use `CWT_preprocess` to transform SSVEP signals into time-frequency representations. Since the CWT process is time-consuming, it is recommended to store the processed data instead of performing real-time CWT. The transformed data can occupy a large amount of memory, so you can adjust the `overlap` parameter in the `slice_and_cwt` function to control the data augmentation factor and alleviate excessive memory usage.
